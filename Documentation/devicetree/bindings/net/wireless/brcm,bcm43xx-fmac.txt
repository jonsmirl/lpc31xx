Broadcom BCM43xx Fullmac wireless SDIO devices

This node provides properties for controlling the Broadcom wireless device. The
node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO controller that
connects the device to the system.

Required properties:

 - compatible : Should be "brcm,bcm43xx-fmac".

Optional properties:
 - brcm,drive-strength : drive strength used for SDIO pins on device.
	(default = 6mA).
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
	device interrupts are connected.
 - interrupts : specifies attributes for the out-of-band interrupt (host-wake).
	When not specified the device will use in-band SDIO interrupts.
 - interrupt-names : name of the out-of-band interrupt, which must be set
	to "host-wake".

Example:

bcm4335 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm43xx-fmac";
	brcm,drive-strength = <4>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpx2>;
	interrupts = <5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "host-wake";
};
